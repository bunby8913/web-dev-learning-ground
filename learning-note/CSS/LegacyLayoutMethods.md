# Legacy layout methods

### A 2 column layout

- Use percentage for the wrapped content (For responsive design)
- The "float" keyword determine the relations between other columns

### Flexbox grids?

- Flexbox is cool but not designed as a grid system alternative
- Flexbox is a 1D design, row / column, but does not create strict grid to use
  - Just fill the space
