# Cascade layers

- Help to manage code base from different parties, plugins + development teams
- Only 1 value can be applied to CSS element property
  - Developer tools shows the selector being used + value being applied to the property
  - Style panel also shows the crossed-out (not applied) value for each property (due to cascade)
